# Monitoring your Golang server with Prometheus and Grafana

This is the source code for my article on [Medium]().

The application is a very simple example on how you can use Prometheus to collect information from your application and then use Grafana to visualise the information collected.

## How to run the application

It is recommended to use VSCode with the [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extension and Docker to run the application without the need to install additional software on your machine.

Open the source code on VSCode and then click on `Reopen in Container` (if you are having troubles, trying following the [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)).

Once the initialisation is finished, you should have three containers running under the name `go-prometheus-grafana`. You can now start 
the application.
